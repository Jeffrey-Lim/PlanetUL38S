    speech: And so, Fred and Gertrude were rescued from Planet UL-38/S by Donald Trump
      himself. They told him about their findings of the yet unknown planet. Trump
      liked the idea of owning his very own habitable planet, so he decided to colonise
      it. Will he succeed... or will Kim Jong-un be first? You'll find out in the
      sequel "The battle for Planet UL-38/S". But for now, Fred and Gertrude's story
      has come to an end
