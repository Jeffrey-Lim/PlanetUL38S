After a crash landing on a mysterious red planet, Fred and Gertrude are stuck in a dangerous environment with hostile aliens. 
As Fred, you must fight the enemies, find food and collectables, and find a way to escape this planet. 

This game was made in Unity 5.4.0f3 in 2017-2018 as part of a high school assignment. Don't expect it to be of high quality. 

## Usage
Currently (as of April 2024), the Unity 5.4.0f3 editor crashes after logging in. It also doesn't work on newer versions of Unity due to the usage of deprecated APIs.
Maybe someday I will revisit this project and upgrade it to work with newer versions of Unity. 
The only way to run the game now is to download the [binary](https://github.com/Jeffrey-Lim/PlanetUL38S/releases/tag/1.0.0) and run it on Windows.
